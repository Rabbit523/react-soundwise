          content creators (the “Publishers,” collectively with Listeners, “you” or the “Users,”
          each a “User”) who provide audio training materials (the “Soundcasts”) through
          https://mysoundwise.com/ and subdomains, mobile applications, and other media managed by
          Soundwise (collectively, the “Sites”).

        <p>
          <strong>(a) </strong>“<strong>User Content</strong>” means any and all information and
          content that a user submits to, or uses with, the Sites (e.g., content in the user’s
          profile or postings). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all
          risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy,
          completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that
          personally identifies you or any third party. You hereby represent and warrant that your
          User Content does not violate our Acceptable Use Policy (defined in Section 3.5). You may
          not represent or imply to others that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored
          or endorsed by Company. Because you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may
          expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates the Acceptable
          Use Policy. Company is not obligated to backup any User Content, and your User Content may
          be deleted at any time without prior notice. You are solely responsible for creating and
          maintaining your own backup copies of your User Content if you desire.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(b) </strong>
          User Content is and remains that User’s property, and Soundwise’s only right to that User
          Content is the limited licenses to it granted in these Terms of Use. The Sites, and all
          Content other than User Content and all software available on the Sites or used to create
          and operate the Sites, is and remains the property of Soundwise, and is protected under
          the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, and other intellectual property laws of the United
          States and any foreign jurisdiction where the Sites are accessed, and all rights to the
          Sites, such Content, and such software are expressly reserved. All trademarks and service
          marks, whether registered or unregistered, as well as product names and company names or
          logos, displayed or mentioned on the Sites are the property of their respective owners.
          Reference to any products, services, processes, or other information, by trade name,
          trademark, manufacturer, supplier, or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement,
          sponsorship, or recommendation thereof by Soundwise.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(c) </strong>
          Your User Content is your responsibility. Soundwise does not control or monitor User
          Content and, as such, does not guarantee in any manner the content, reliability, validity,
          accuracy, or truthfulness of such User Content, including but not limited to Content
          presented through the Soundcasts. By using the Services, you may be exposed to User
          Content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Soundwise has no
          responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or use of
          any User Content to the extent permissible by law. Although we have no obligation to do
          so, we have the absolute discretion to remove, screen, or edit without notice any User
          Content posted or stored on the Sites, and we may do this at any time and for any reason.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.2 </strong>
          <strong>Your Limited License of Your User Content to Soundwise. </strong>
          While Soundwise does not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, we do need the
          right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Sites and provide
          the Services, now and in the future. For example, when a Publisher makes Soundcast
          materials available to its Listeners through the Sites or a Listener communicates with a
          Publisher on a comment section, Soundwise needs a license from those Users to display
          their respective Content on the Sites, as well as the right to sublicense that User
          Content to our other Users so that they can view that User Content. Therefore, by posting
          or distributing Content to or through the Sites, each User grants to Soundwise, and its
          affiliates and subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable,
          worldwide license and right to use, display, publicly perform, reproduce, distribute,
          publish, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, and otherwise use and
          exploit such User Content that you upload, transmit, or post on the Sites or through the
          Services, in the manner in and for the purposes for which the Sites from time to time uses
          such User Content. In doing so, the User represents and warrants that it owns and controls
          all of the rights to the User Content that it posts or otherwise distributes, and has the
          lawful right to post and distribute that User Content, to or through the Sites, and the
          use and posting or other transmission of such User Content does not violate these Terms of
          Use and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any other person or entity. If
          your User Content is intended for the use by other Users, you also grant us and our
          affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to
          sublicense such User Content to such Users for their use in connection with their use of
          the Sites.

        <p>
          <strong>3.3 </strong>
          <strong>Soundwise’s Limited License of Content to Users. </strong>
          Soundwise grants to Users a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license
          to view, copy, and print the portions of the Content available to Users on the Sites. For
          Listeners, this includes access and use of the Soundcasts and content provided therein,
          which they have subscribed to and paid all required fees for. Such license is subject to
          these Terms of Use, and specifically conditioned upon the following:
          <p />

          · Users may only view, copy, and print such portions of the Content for their own use;
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          · Users may not modify or otherwise make derivative works of the Content, or reproduce,
          distribute, or display the Content (except for page caching) except as expressly permitted
          in these Terms of Use;
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          · Users may not remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices
          that have been placed in the Content;
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          · Users may not use any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering or extraction
          methods; and
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          · Users may not use the Sites or Content other than for their intended purposes.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as expressly permitted above, any use of any portion of Content without the prior
          written permission of its owner is strictly prohibited and will terminate the license
          granted herein, these Terms of Use, and your access to the Sites. Any such unauthorized
          use may also violate applicable laws, including without limitation copyright and trademark
          laws. Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms of Use may be construed as
          conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppels, implication,
          or otherwise. Soundwise may revoke this license at any time for any reason or no reason,
          and shall not be liable to any User for any purported interference with business or
          contractual relations, in tort or otherwise. Users represent and warrant that their use of
          the Sites and the Content will remain consistent with this license and will not infringe
          or violate the rights of any other party or breach any contract or legal duty to any other
          parties, or violate any applicable law. To request permission for uses of Content not
          included in this license, you may contact Soundwise at the address set out at the bottom
          of these Terms of Use.

          through Company’s payment gateway. Company is not liable for any disputes, claims, losses,
          injuries, or damage of any kind that may arise out of the Publisher/Listener relationship,

          Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Sites do
          the same. In connection with our Sites, we have adopted and implemented a policy
          respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for
          the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our online Sites who are repeat
          infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one
          of our users is, through the use of our Sites, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a

          information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be

          <strong>Dispute Resolution. </strong>

          <strong>
            <em>
              Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with
              Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING
              ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(a) </strong>
          <em>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</em>
          All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set
          forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by
          the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved
          by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration
          Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
          English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
          subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and
          assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or
          goods provided under the Terms.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(b) </strong>
          <em>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</em>. Before either party may seek
          arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (
          <strong>“Notice”</strong>) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and
          the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: Unit 302, 2818
          Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, District Of Columbia 20008. After the Notice is received,
          you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the
          Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
          received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement
          offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
          has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(c) </strong>
          Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration
          Association (<strong>“AAA”</strong>
          ), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<strong>“ADR Provider”</strong>
          ) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to
          arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the
          ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the
          method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in
          conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ({' '}
          <strong>“Arbitration Rules”</strong>) governing the arbitration are available online at{' '}
          <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org </a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The
          arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes
          where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US
          $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the
          option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the
          award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing
          will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within
          100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless
          the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give
          the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
          judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
          jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
          settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the
          Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own
          costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and
          shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(d) </strong>
          <em>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration</em>. If non-appearance based
          arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or
          based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
          initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by
          the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(e) </strong>
          <em>Time Limits.</em>
          If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or
          demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim)
          and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(f) </strong>
          <em>Authority of Arbitrator</em>. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide
          the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be
          consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
          arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
          claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
          non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA
          Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
          describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including
          the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award
          relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
          arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(g) </strong>
          <em>Waiver of Jury Trial. </em>
          THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE
          A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall
          be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are
          typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court
          and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should
          arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or
          enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
          TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(h) </strong>
          <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE
          OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
          NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
          LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i) </strong>
          <em>Confidentiality</em>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not
          limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly
          confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by
          law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
          information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to
          seek injunctive or equitable relief.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(j) </strong>
          <em>Severability</em>. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under
          the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such
          specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the
          remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(k) </strong>
          <em>Right to Waive. </em>
          Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be
          waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or
          affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(l) </strong>
          <em>Survival of Agreement</em>. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of
          your relationship with Company.
          <p />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(m) </strong>
          <em>Small Claims Court. </em>
